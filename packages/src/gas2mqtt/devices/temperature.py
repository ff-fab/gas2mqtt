"""Temperature telemetry device — periodic temperature reporting.

Reads raw temperature from the QMC5883L magnetometer, applies
empirical calibration (temp_scale * raw + temp_offset), and smooths
with an EWMA filter.

The handler is created via ``make_temperature_handler()``, which
captures the magnetometer adapter and settings in a closure.  The
:class:`EwmaFilter` state persists across calls because it lives
inside the closure.

MQTT state payload::

    {"temperature": 21.5}
